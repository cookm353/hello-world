# hello-world

Hello all!

This is just my first repository, following the guide from the website.  I'll be using this site to store projects and capstones I've made along the way as I improved my skills in Python from where I am now (beginner with some experience in Java) to wherever my path leads.

I'll do my best to upload projects on a regular basis so I can see how my skills improve.  While using a site such as Coursera I'll only upload the assigned projects so I don't just include programs I'm basically walked through.  When my skills have progressed, I'll begin uploading challenges from LeetCode, Exercism, Kaggle, and other similar sites.
